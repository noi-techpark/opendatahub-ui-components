# OpenDataHub shared web components
This repo will host shared UI component packagages for use in the databrowser, analytics and other projects


## REUSE
This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
